    </header>
    <p>
        For decades Linux has been the cornerstone of open-source computing, empowering users and businessess alike worldwide with its flexibility and power. 
				Linux is probably even in your phone.
        The journey began in <strong>1991</strong>, when Linus Torvalds, then a Finnish university student, created the Linux kernel as a free alternative to proprietary operating systems. 
        His vision of collaborative software development and the contributions of developers across the globe have made Linux a foundational part of modern computing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Meanwhile, the free software movement, championed by visionaries like Richard Stallman, also played a critical role. Stallman’s work on the GNU Project 
        provided practically all the essential tools and philosophies that laid the groundwork for the open-source community we know today. Together, these efforts 
        have inspired countless innovations and a global community dedicated to sharing knowledge and improving technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>LinuxNetwork.com</strong> was founded in <strong>1997</strong>, a pivotal year during the dot-com boom when nearly every word in the dictionary was being bought up for web addresses. 
        I purchased the domain with a vision to create a hub for Linux enthusiasts. Over the years, the site became a valuable resource for the 
        <a href="https://tldp.org" target="_blank">Linux Documentation Project</a>, offering guides and insights to help users and developers master the Linux ecosystem. 
        It also featured practical tutorials, such as step-by-step instructions for setting up a home NAT router—an essential skill for early adopters of home networking.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, I have ambitious plans for LinuxNetwork.com, aiming to re-establish it as a go-to resource for the modern Linux community. Whether you're a developer, 
        system administrator, or just beginning your journey with Linux, this site will continue to champion the open-source philosophy that started it all.
